Repository to try out BDD and Agile ideas

Understanding Testing by using BDD

Testing is new to me, so I attempted to do my best with following along with
the lesson plan, and creating as much on my own as possible. Ultimately I used
the examples more than I would have liked, but it helped me learn quite a bit.

I had no collaborators on this assignment, although perhaps I should have.

I've run into trouble with my Git repos, which will have to be sorted. However
my tests are green lighting.
